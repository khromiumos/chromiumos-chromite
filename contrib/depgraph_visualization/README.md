# Depgraph visualizer

## Installation

Create a virtualenv inside the SDK at the path of your choosing, activate that
virtualenv, then from this project's directory run the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

This will put a script called `visualize_depgraph` on your PATH. From there you
can run `visualize_depgraph --help` to see the available options.
